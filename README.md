# R shiny spotify app
This R shiny app obtains genre, artist, and album data through an R package that leverages spotify's api. The result is a nifty little app that allows the user to compare artist album variables (e.g. loudness vs tempo) from a finite amount of genres. See this link to see it in action (may need up to 10 seconds to load):
